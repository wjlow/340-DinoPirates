\chapter{Introduction}

\section{Project Overview}

\subsection {The Client}

\subsection{Users of the System}
The main users of the system will be:
\begin{itemize}
\item{biologists}
\item{statisticians}
\item{clinicians}
\item{bioinformaticians}
\end{itemize}

All users are expected to have prior basic computer knowledge as well as
sufficient knowledge in their field to BLAST sequences. 
Users are also expected to know the following information.
\begin{itemize}
\item{Names and location of input and reference files}
\item{If an input file has a paired end}
\item{Values to set the quality threshold}
\item{Groups that should be formed}
\item{Unique identification region}
\item{Columns for the output table}
\item{BLAST region in the input and reference files}
\item{Parameter values for BLASTing}
\item{Number of threads}
\item{Location to save files} 
\end{itemize}


\section{Audience of the Document}

This document is targeted towards the users so that the users will be easily be
able to adapt to the new system to pre-process and BLAST DNA sequences.
The document is also meant for the maintenance team and the client to refer to in the future so they will have a good understanding of the system for when are to explain and demonstrate the system to new users.
